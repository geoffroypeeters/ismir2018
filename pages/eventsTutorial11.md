## Overview and New Challenges of Music Recommendation Research in 2018

**Speakers: Markus Schedl, Peter Knees, Fabien Gouyon**

**Abstract:** The current revolution in the music industry represents great opportunities and challenges for music recommendation systems. Recommendation systems are now central to music streaming platforms, which are rapidly increasing in listenership and becoming the top source of revenue for the music industry. It is increasingly more common for a music listener to simply access music than to purchase and own it in a personal collection. In this scenario, recommendation calls no longer for a one-shot recommendation for the purpose of a track or album purchase, but for a recommendation of a listening experience, comprising a very wide range of challenges, such as sequential recommendation, or conversational and contextual recommendations. Recommendation technologies now impact all actors in the rich and complex music industry ecosystem (listeners, labels, music makers and producers, concert halls, advertisers, etc.).

To acknowledge these developments, we give an introductory tutorial providing an overview of music recommendation research, as well as the challenges it faces today. We focus on three use cases: automatic playlist generation, context-aware music recommendation, and recommendation in the creative process of music making.
